					Hathor is a way to democratize the playqueue of spotify at parties. It lets everyone at the party
					suggest what song should be played and also allows everyone at the party to up-vote a certain song
					if they want to hear it sooner. No more battling over spotify. No more theiving in the play queue.
					No more worries someone will tinker with your computer when they use spotify.

				<p><h4>Start Spotify - Start Party - Share Party!</h4></p>

					Hathor is a project by 4 students at Linköping university studying M.Sc Media technology &amp; engineering.
					It was made during 3 months as part of the course TMN040, "Communication and User interfaces".
